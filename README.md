## Setup
- Data Cleanup: All original data files can be found in the Resources folder.  The notebook titled data_cleanup.ipynb contains all the codes for data cleaning and preparation for database upload.
- Data Exploration: The notebook titled Project4-Visualizations.ipynb ingests the clean data and does a variety of exploratory views of the salary and layoff dataset. There are cooresponding visualizations for the different views and datasets.
- Statistical Analysis: The notebook titled datasciencesalaries_corr_update2.ipynb contains all the statistical analysis on the salaries dataset.
- Machine Learning:
- Databases: Cleaned datasets imported to Postgresql with using file titled schems.sql.  Also imported to MongoDB when running codes in data_cleanup.ipynb.

## Room for Improvement

Room for improvement:
- Salaries dataset used in project contain years 2017-2021 and layoffs dataset contain years 2020-2023. Retrieve updated salary and layoff data at https://www.levels.fyi/ and https://layoffs.fyi/ using Web Scraping and ETL.
- Create an Interactive Layoff Predictor on the HTML
