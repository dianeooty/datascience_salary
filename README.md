## Setup
- Data Cleanup: All original data files can be found in the Resources folder.  The notebook titled salaries-cleaned.ipynb contains all the codes for data cleaning and preparation for database upload.
- Data Exploration: The notebook titled Project4-Visualizations.ipynb ingests the clean data and does a variety of exploratory views of the salary and layoff dataset. There are cooresponding visualizations for the different views and datasets.

## Project Status
Project is in progress


## Room for Improvement

Room for improvement:
- Salaries dataset used in project contain years 2018-2021 and layoffs dataset contain years 2020-2023. Retrieve updated salary and layoff data at https://www.levels.fyi/ and https://layoffs.fyi/ using Web Scraping and ETL.
- Create an Interactive Layoff Predictor on the HTML.
